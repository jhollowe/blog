While the networking side will not be covered now, a very important aspect will be: passwordless SSH.
Inter-node SSH The first task to getting easy access between nodes is ensuring SSH access between all the nodes.
While not necessary, I recommend adding all your nodes to the /etc/hosts file on each node. For example, the /etc/hosts file might look like</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/raspberry-pis.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>SSH</category><category>cluster</category><category>guide</category><category>networks</category><category>Raspberry Pi Cluster</category></item><item><title>Clemson SoC 101</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/clemson-soc-101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 20:08:42 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 20:08:42 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/clemson-soc-101/</guid><description>Clemson&amp;rsquo;s School of Computing (SoC) is the place at Clemson where Computer Science (CPSC), Computer Information Systems (CIS), and Digital Production Arts (DPA) are located. Other computing departments (like Computer Engineering) also use some of the SoC&amp;rsquo;s systems. Below are some useful tips and tools for quickly getting going in the SoC.
Access Servers The access servers are the way you can access all the SoC computers from off-campus (without having to use the VPN).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>101</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item><item><title>Accessing Your Clemson Network Shares</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/accessing-your-clemson-network-shares/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:08:51 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:08:51 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/accessing-your-clemson-network-shares/</guid><description>Clemson University’s computer labs store files across all the computers using network shares. You usually just access these shares on the lab machines, but you can also add the shares on your own computer as a network drive.
There are two main shares on campus: the campus share used by all the Windows (and Mac?) lab machines (e.g. in Cooper Library, Martin, etc.) and the School of Computing’s Linux systems. Both systems can be accessed in a similar way, but with different settings.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>clemson</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item><item><title>A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at my extended family&amp;rsquo;s house way out in the middle of nowhere; barely enough cellular connection for a SMS, let alone trying to use any data.
They have DSL, but they are so far out that the signal is poor and it also is horrible speed. The fastest I saw while I was there was 700Kbps.
While it is always a shock to go from over 100Mbps to under 1Mbps, I think that we are in an age where low bandwidth is not a show-stopper.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category><category>networks</category></item><item><title>And So It Begins</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/and-so-it-begins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 15:00:25 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 15:00:25 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/and-so-it-begins/</guid><description>2021. A new year; a new start.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a while, and I thought I might as well start it on the first of the year. I think I finally have enough things I want to talk about that a blog is worth the effort.
What&amp;rsquo;s in a Name? So why the name &amp;ldquo;/dev/random&amp;rdquo;? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m a geek and this blog will be about anything. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to confine this blog to any one subject (including to just tech) and I want the entirety of the blog to be representative of that.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>meta</category></item></channel></rss>
