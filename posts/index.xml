I just got over having no internet at my apartment for over a week. I was gone a portion of the week, but it was still very inconvenient. Working remotely doesn&amp;rsquo;t help as to get paid I need to have an internet connection (but not necessarily a fast connection).
Working Around It While I could have use cellular data to carry me through, I had already used a significant portion of my data cap on various travels this summer.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/no-internet.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category><category>networks</category></item><item><title>Getting Started With Devcontainers</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/getting-started-with-devcontainers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 20:06:55 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 20:06:55 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/getting-started-with-devcontainers/</guid><description>Setting up and maintaining a development environment is hard, especially when you need to destructively test features or libraries. Especially for contributing to a new project, you don&amp;rsquo;t know everything that is needed. Sometimes the install/development instructions assume some base tools or packages that are not included in your development environment of choice.
In come devcontainers. Rather than having to search through the README for a project you are wanting to contribute to, installing several packages onto your machine, and troubleshooting when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you can simply open the repository as a devcontainer and you are ready to start contributing.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/vscode_remote-containers.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>development</category><category>containers</category><category>101</category><category>guide</category></item><item><title>TIL: AD Forests</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/til-ad-forests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 06:10:52 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 06:10:52 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/til-ad-forests/</guid><description>For environments with complex Active Directory (AD) environments, AD forests can allow flexibility in management and organization of objects.
Basically, an AD forest allows multiple domains and trees of domains (subdomains) to access and have a shared configuration while still having separate domains with separate host servers.
They allow domains to trust and access each other while still maintain separations and boarders. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this used to allow corporate and client domains to communicate or to have a development domain tree that trust and can cross-talk with the production domain tree while still being separate (this is less common as dev domains are usually just subdomains within the production tree).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/ad_forest.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>Active Directory</category><category>TIL</category></item><item><title>Change Username Without Separate Session</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/change-username-without-separate-session/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:51:50 -0400</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:51:50 -0400</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/change-username-without-separate-session/</guid><description>Changing a user&amp;rsquo;s username on Linux requires no processes be running under that user. This makes sense, but what if we only have that user accessible through a SSh connection? What if we don&amp;rsquo;t want to allow external access to the root account? What if the root account doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a password?

While the networking side will not be covered now, a very important aspect will be: passwordless SSH.
Inter-node SSH The first task to getting easy access between nodes is ensuring SSH access between all the nodes.
While not necessary, I recommend adding all your nodes to the /etc/hosts file on each node. For example, the /etc/hosts file might look like</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/bash_logo.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>SSH</category><category>cluster</category><category>networks</category><category>guide</category><category>networks</category><category>Raspberry Pi Cluster</category></item><item><title>Basic Cluster Setup</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/basic-cluster-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 14:50:38 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 14:50:38 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/basic-cluster-setup/</guid><description>So you want to build a Raspberry Pi cluster.
The first thing to do is determine the size of a cluster you want to build. You can go with any number greater than one, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found that 4-8 is a good sweet spot between too few nodes to get a real feel of cluster operation and too many nodes to manage and maintain. For this and following posts, I will be assuming a cluster of 4 nodes (node01 to node04).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/raspberry-pis.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>cluster</category><category>networks</category><category>hardware</category><category>Raspberry Pi Cluster</category></item><item><title>Clemson SoC 101</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/clemson-soc-101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 20:08:42 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 20:08:42 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/clemson-soc-101/</guid><description>Clemson&amp;rsquo;s School of Computing (SoC) is the place at Clemson where Computer Science (CPSC), Computer Information Systems (CIS), and Digital Production Arts (DPA) are located. Other computing departments (like Computer Engineering) also use some of the SoC&amp;rsquo;s systems. Below are some useful tips and tools for quickly getting going in the SoC.
Access Servers The access servers are the way you can access all the SoC computers from off-campus (without having to use the VPN).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>101</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item><item><title>Accessing Your Clemson Network Shares</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/accessing-your-clemson-network-shares/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:08:51 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:08:51 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/accessing-your-clemson-network-shares/</guid><description>Clemson University’s computer labs store files across all the computers using network shares. You usually just access these shares on the lab machines, but you can also add the shares on your own computer as a network drive.
There are two main shares on campus: the campus share used by all the Windows (and Mac?) lab machines (e.g. in Cooper Library, Martin, etc.) and the School of Computing’s Linux systems. Both systems can be accessed in a similar way, but with different settings.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>clemson</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item><item><title>A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at my extended family&amp;rsquo;s house way out in the middle of nowhere; barely enough cellular connection for a SMS, let alone trying to use any data.
They have DSL, but they are so far out that the signal is poor and it also is horrible speed. The fastest I saw while I was there was 700Kbps.
While it is always a shock to go from over 100Mbps to under 1Mbps, I think that we are in an age where low bandwidth is not a show-stopper.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category><category>networks</category></item><item><title>And So It Begins</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/and-so-it-begins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 15:00:25 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 15:00:25 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/and-so-it-begins/</guid><description>2021. A new year; a new start.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a while, and I thought I might as well start it on the first of the year. I think I finally have enough things I want to talk about that a blog is worth the effort.
What&amp;rsquo;s in a Name? So why the name &amp;ldquo;/dev/random&amp;rdquo;? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m a geek and this blog will be about anything. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to confine this blog to any one subject (including to just tech) and I want the entirety of the blog to be representative of that.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>meta</category></item></channel></rss>
