They have DSL, but they are so far out that the signal is poor and it also is horrible speed. The fastest I saw while I was there was 700Kbps.
While it is always a shock to go from over 100Mbps to under 1Mbps, I think that we are in an age where low bandwidth is not a show-stopper.</description><dc:creator>John</dc:creator><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category><category>networks</category></item><item><title>And So It Begins</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/and-so-it-begins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 15:00:25 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 16:20:22 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/and-so-it-begins/</guid><description>2021. A new year; a new start.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a while, and I thought I might as well start it on the first of the year. I think I finally have enough things I want to talk about that a blog is worth the effort.
What&amp;rsquo;s in a Name? So why the name &amp;ldquo;/dev/random&amp;rdquo;? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m a geek and this blog will be about anything. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to confine this blog to any one subject (including to just tech) and I want the entirety of the blog to be representative of that.</description><dc:creator>John</dc:creator><category>meta</category></item></channel></rss>
