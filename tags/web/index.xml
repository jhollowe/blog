I just got over having no internet at my apartment for over a week. I was gone a portion of the week, but it was still very inconvenient. Working remotely doesn&amp;rsquo;t help as to get paid I need to have an internet connection (but not necessarily a fast connection).

They have DSL, but they are so far out that the signal is poor and it also is horrible speed. The fastest I saw while I was there was 700Kbps.
While it is always a shock to go from over 100Mbps to under 1Mbps, I think that we are in an age where low bandwidth is not a show-stopper.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category><category>networks</category></item></channel></rss>
