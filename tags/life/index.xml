The transition from my old 15&amp;quot; laptop to this 13&amp;quot; Framework has been a lot more seamless than I thought it would be. It has worked perfectly for everything I&amp;rsquo;ve put it through.
My Experience With My Framework Battery Life Even with the recently-replaced batter in my old laptop, my Framework has a much longer battery life. Likely a combination of both the battery and processor, I&amp;rsquo;m able to get many hours of even a demanding workload.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/framework.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware</category><category>life</category><category>review</category><category>framework</category></item><item><title>Framework First Impressions</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/framework-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:10:42 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:10:42 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/framework-first-impressions/</guid><description>I recently upgraded my laptop to a Framework laptop since my old trusty laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen cracked and a replacement screen cost as much as some new laptops. These are my initial impressions of the laptop&amp;rsquo;s build, performance, and usability.
Use Case I have a bit of a minimal use case for my laptop. Since I have a powerful desktop and a fairly performant phone, I don&amp;rsquo;t need my laptop to be a do-everything device.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/framework.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware</category><category>life</category><category>review</category><category>framework laptop</category></item><item><title>All Things Open 2022 Impressions</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/ato22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:58:11 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:58:11 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/ato22/</guid><description>This was my first year going to the All Things Open and my first in-person conference in several years.
Overall, I really enjoyed the conference and would recommend other&amp;rsquo;s attend. It definitely helped that I already live in Raleigh so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to travel to the conference, but even traveling to the conference would be a good experience.
Venue The Raleigh conference center is a spacious venue. The paths to the session rooms are wide and easy to access.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/ato22.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>life</category><category>ATO</category><category>conference</category></item><item><title>A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at my extended family&amp;rsquo;s house way out in the middle of nowhere; barely enough cellular connection for an SMS, let alone trying to use any data.
They have DSL, but they are so far out that the signal is poor and it also is horrible speed. The fastest I saw while I was there was 700Kbps.
While it is always a shock to go from over 100Mbps to under 1Mbps, I think that we are in an age where low bandwidth is not a show-stopper.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>networks</category><category>opinion</category></item></channel></rss>
