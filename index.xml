The transition from my old 15&amp;quot; laptop to this 13&amp;quot; Framework has been a lot more seamless than I thought it would be. It has worked perfectly for everything I&amp;rsquo;ve put it through.
My Experience With My Framework Battery Life Even with the recently-replaced batter in my old laptop, my Framework has a much longer battery life. Likely a combination of both the battery and processor, I&amp;rsquo;m able to get many hours of even a demanding workload.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/framework.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware</category><category>life</category><category>review</category><category>framework</category></item><item><title>Framework First Impressions</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/framework-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:10:42 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:10:42 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/framework-first-impressions/</guid><description>I recently upgraded my laptop to a Framework laptop since my old trusty laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen cracked and a replacement screen cost as much as some new laptops. These are my initial impressions of the laptop&amp;rsquo;s build, performance, and usability.
Use Case I have a bit of a minimal use case for my laptop. Since I have a powerful desktop and a fairly performant phone, I don&amp;rsquo;t need my laptop to be a do-everything device.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/framework.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware</category><category>life</category><category>review</category><category>framework laptop</category></item><item><title>NVMe Boot in Proxmox on Older BIOS</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/nvme-proxmox-bios/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 18:54:12 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 18:54:12 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/nvme-proxmox-bios/</guid><description>Trying to boot off an NVMe drive on older hardware can cause some issues. If you are running an older BIOS/UEFI, it may not have the needed drivers to understand how to talk to a NVMe drive. I ran into this exact issue when trying to boot my Dell R510 from an NVMe drive.
To boot from NVMe, I would need to use some shim which could be booted by the BIOS which would chain-boot the actual OS on the NVMe.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>sysadmin</category><category>proxmox</category></item><item><title>All Things Open 2022 Impressions</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/ato22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:58:11 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:58:11 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/ato22/</guid><description>This was my first year going to the All Things Open and my first in-person conference in several years.

TL;DR: Combine the power of ZFS, zStandard, pv, and netcat to have a fast backup of a ZFS snapshot with verbose metrics of the process and progress.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>ZFS</category><category>backup</category><category>sysadmin</category><category>guide</category></item><item><title>TIL: Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM)</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/til-ksm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:39:18 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:39:18 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/til-ksm/</guid><description>I first noticed Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM) while working with Virtual Machines (VMs) under KVM (in Proxmox VE).
KSM is a way of reducing physical memory usage by using one physical page of memory for all duplicate copied of that page. It does this by periodically scanning through memory, finding duplicate pages, and de-duplicating them via virtual memory. It is an extension of how the kernel shares pages between fork()&amp;lsquo;ed processes and uses many of the same methods of sharing memory.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>Linux</category><category>memory</category><category>TIL</category></item><item><title>Nothing Is Definitely Worse Than a Trickle</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/nothing-is-definitely-worse-than-a-trickle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 17:02:39 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 17:02:39 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/nothing-is-definitely-worse-than-a-trickle/</guid><description>Please read A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing before reading this post.

Especially for contributing to a new project, you don&amp;rsquo;t know everything that is needed. Sometimes the install/development instructions assume some base tools or packages that are not included in your development environment of choice.
In come devcontainers. Rather than having to search through the README for a project you are wanting to contribute to, installing several packages onto your machine, and troubleshooting when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you can simply open the repository as a devcontainer and you are ready to start contributing.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/vscode_remote-containers.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>development</category><category>containers</category><category>101</category><category>guide</category></item><item><title>TIL: AD Forests</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/til-ad-forests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 06:10:52 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 06:10:52 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/til-ad-forests/</guid><description>For environments with complex Active Directory (AD) environments, AD forests can allow flexibility in management and organization of objects.
Basically, an AD forest allows multiple domains and trees of domains (subdomains) to access and have a shared configuration while still having separate domains with separate host servers.
They allow domains to trust and access each other while still maintain separations and boarders. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this used to allow corporate and client domains to communicate or to have a development domain tree that trust and can cross-talk with the production domain tree while still being separate (this is less common as dev domains are usually just subdomains within the production tree).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/ad_forest.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>Active Directory</category><category>TIL</category></item><item><title>Change Username Without Separate Session</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/change-username-without-separate-session/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:51:50 -0400</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:51:50 -0400</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/change-username-without-separate-session/</guid><description>Changing a user&amp;rsquo;s username on Linux requires no processes be running under that user.

Inter-node SSH The first task to getting easy access between nodes is ensuring SSH access between all the nodes.
While not necessary, I recommend adding all your nodes to the /etc/hosts file on each node.

The first thing to do is determine the size of a cluster you want to build. You can go with any number greater than one, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found that 4-8 is a good sweet spot between too few nodes to get a real feel of cluster operation and too many nodes to manage and maintain. For this and following posts, I will be assuming a cluster of 4 nodes (node01 to node04).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/raspberry-pis.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>cluster</category><category>networks</category><category>hardware</category><category>Raspberry Pi Cluster</category></item><item><title>Clemson SoC 101</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/clemson-soc-101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 20:08:42 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 20:08:42 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/clemson-soc-101/</guid><description>Clemson&amp;rsquo;s School of Computing (SoC) is the place at Clemson where Computer Science (CPSC), Computer Information Systems (CIS), and Digital Production Arts (DPA) are located.

There are two main shares on campus: the campus share used by all the Windows (and Mac?) lab machines (e.g. in Cooper Library, Martin, etc.) and the School of Computing’s Linux systems.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>clemson</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item><item><title>A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at my extended family&amp;rsquo;s house way out in the middle of nowhere; barely enough cellular connection for an SMS, let alone trying to use any data.
