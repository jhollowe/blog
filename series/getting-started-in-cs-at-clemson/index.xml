Other computing departments (like Computer Engineering) also use some of the SoC&amp;rsquo;s systems. Below are some useful tips and tools for quickly getting going in the SoC.
Access Servers The access servers are the way you can access all the SoC computers from off-campus (without having to use the VPN).</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>101</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item><item><title>Accessing Your Clemson Network Shares</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/accessing-your-clemson-network-shares/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:08:51 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:08:51 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/accessing-your-clemson-network-shares/</guid><description>Clemson University’s computer labs store files across all the computers using network shares. You usually just access these shares on the lab machines, but you can also add the shares on your own computer as a network drive.
There are two main shares on campus: the campus share used by all the Windows (and Mac?) lab machines (e.g. in Cooper Library, Martin, etc.) and the School of Computing’s Linux systems.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>clemson</category><category>Getting started in CS at Clemson</category></item></channel></rss>
