There were a lot of things I learned (obviously), but I think the most useful things I learned were not from the course material, but my outside learning and interactions with peers and professors.
Project Organization All my courses this semester were project based; while some of the grade for the course came from quizzes or homeworks, over 50% came from a semester long project.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/masters-degree-takeaways.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>clemson</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category></item><item><title>Nothing Is Definitely Worse Than a Trickle</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/nothing-is-definitely-worse-than-a-trickle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 17:02:39 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 17:02:39 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/nothing-is-definitely-worse-than-a-trickle/</guid><description>Please read A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing before reading this post. I just got over having no internet at my apartment for over a week. I was gone a portion of the week, but it was still very inconvenient. Working remotely doesn&amp;rsquo;t help as to get paid I need to have an internet connection (but not necessarily a fast connection).
Working Around It While I could have use cellular data to carry me through, I had already used a significant portion of my data cap on various travels this summer.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><media:content url="https://johnhollowell.com/blog/post-cover-image/no-internet.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>opinion</category><category>networks</category></item><item><title>A Trickle Is Better Than Nothing</title><link>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</pubDate><author>contact@johnhollowell.com (John Hollowell)</author><atom:modified>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 21:31:47 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://johnhollowell.com/blog/posts/a-trickle-is-better-than-nothing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at my extended family&amp;rsquo;s house way out in the middle of nowhere; barely enough cellular connection for an SMS, let alone trying to use any data.
They have DSL, but they are so far out that the signal is poor and it also is horrible speed. The fastest I saw while I was there was 700Kbps.
While it is always a shock to go from over 100Mbps to under 1Mbps, I think that we are in an age where low bandwidth is not a show-stopper.</description><dc:creator>John Hollowell</dc:creator><category>web</category><category>life</category><category>networks</category><category>opinion</category></item></channel></rss>
