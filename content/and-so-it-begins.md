2021. A new year; a new start.

I've wanted to start a blog for a while, and I thought I might as well start it on the first of the year. I think I finally have enough things I want to talk about that a blog is worth the effort.

## What's in a Name?

So why the name "/dev/random"? Well, I'm a geek and this blog will be about anything. I don't want to confine this blog to any one subject (including to just tech) and I want the entirety of the blog to be representative of that. It also give me the opportunity to have a punny subtitle, which I am always appreciative of.

## So... Why?

This blog is mostly a place for me to put information for my future self and others. Don't expect any deep, rambling prose. I'm not a spectacular writer and there are many things in my life that don't merit blogging about. However, I have a vary wide range of knowledge whihc I often will forget by the next time I need to use it. This gives me a way to record my experiences and experiments in a public place to which I can reference others. This blog is also an experiment, how meta is that?


## When can I get more of this *great* content?

I would like to at least work on this blog every day. That doesn't mean a new post every day; longer and more detailed posts will take me at least several days. I might hold a post so a whole series can be release together. I might get bored and never create another post. Who Knows?
